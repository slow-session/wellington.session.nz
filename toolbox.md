This page has links to tools that are useful for anyone wanting to work with ABC and MP3 files.

[editABC](/editABC/)
-------
If you have some ABC you want to edit you can use the [editABC](/editABC/) page.

Simply replace the ABC on that page with your ABC and the musical notation should
redraw. You can also listen to your version played through the ABC player we use
on the various *session.nz* webpages

[Create MD File](/createMD/)
--------
If you want to help us add a new tune to the archive you can use the
[Create MD File](/createMD/) page to create the metadata we need.

If you can provide an MP3 file with a standalone version of the tune which people
can use to learn by ear that would be great. We need that recording to be either:

 * in the public domain
 * have a licence that allows us to use it freely like Creative Commons
 * have clear permission from the copyright holder allowing us to use it for this site

You can usually find some ABC that you can at least start with on
[The Session](http://thesession.org) website. The ABC doesn't need to match the
recorded version exactly - close is good enough!

[Create Set MD File](/createSetMD/)
--------

If you want to help us add a new set to the archive you can use the
[Create Set MD File](/createSetMD/) page to create the metadata we need.

Send your set suggestion to <a href="{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a> and
we'll have a look.

[playMP3](/playMP3/)
-------
If you come across audio files on the Internet that aren't on our site you can use
the [playMP3](/playMP3/) page to slow down a number of audio and video formats and
play parts of them in a loop.

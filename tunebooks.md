Some of you would like to have printable copies of the music. We've taken all tunes we've collected and produced some different options:

* [current.pdf](/abc-collections/current.pdf "PDF") - PDF containing the Wellington Slow Session tunes
* [archive.pdf](/abc-collections/archive.pdf "PDF") - PDF containing all the tunes on the site sorted by 'Jigs', 'Reels', 'Polkas' etv
* [archive-alpha.pdf](/abc-collections/archive-alpha.pdf "PDF") - PDF containing all the tunes on the site sorted alphabetically
* [2bar.pdf](/abc-collections/2bar.pdf "PDF") - PDF with just the first two bars of the tunes
  * Some people like this as a handy reference when they can't think how a tune starts!

You can also get copies of the ABC files that were used to generate these PDFs:

* [current.abc](/abc-collections/current.abc "ABC")
* [archive.abc](/abc-collections/archive.abc "ABC")
* [archive-alpha.abc](/abc-collections/archive-alpha.abc "ABC")
* [2bar.abc](/abc-collections/2bar.abc "ABC")

You can also search our archive for single tunes by name or particular types of tunes e.g. Reels, Slip Jigs, Polkas and print out copies of the sheet music. If you try this **Please be patient! It takes a while to generate all the dots!**

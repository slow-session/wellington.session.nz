Some of you like to have printable copies of the music. We've taken all tunes we've
collected and produced some different options:

* [current-by-type.pdf](/tunebooks/current-by-type.pdf "PDF") - PDF containing the Wellington Session tunes
* [current-alphabetical.pdf](/tunebooks/current-alphabetical.pdf "PDF") - PDF containing the Wellington Session tunes in alphabetical order
* [2bar-by-type.pdf](/tunebooks/2bar-by-type.pdf "PDF") - PDF with just the first two bars of the tunes
* [2bar-alphabetical.pdf](/tunebooks/2bar-alphabetical.pdf "PDF") - PDF with just the first two bars of the tunes in alphabetical order
* [slow-favourite-alphabetical.pdf](/tunebooks/slow-favourite-alphabetical.pdf "PDF") - Frequently played tunes in the slow session in a tunebook

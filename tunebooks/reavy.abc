******************* Ed Reavy Tunes *************************

This file contains a few of my favorite tunes by the late Ed Reavy.
Reavy was not only an accomplished fiddler, but managed to write some
of the most intriguing and beautiful tunes out there.

These are merely some of the few he wrote that I know how to play...

Rather than actually trying to transcribe my own playing, I chose to
copy them out of the book Where_The_Shannon_Rises, which is long out
of print (I believe it was a private publication).

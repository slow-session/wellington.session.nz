These scripts are used to add extra features to the website such as:

* updating the tunebook PDF files
* generating the copyright pull down lists used in createMD
* generating .csv files listing details of where tunes are played

In some cases they will need to have additional software installed such as:

* abcm2ps
* ps2pdf

You can install these using the Brew system e.g.

$ brew install abcm2ps

The Wellington Session happens on Tuesday nights from 7:30 p.m. at the Welsh Dragon Bar, 10/12 Cambridge Terrace, Wellington 6011, New Zealand. All players of traditional Irish music are welcome. The session starts slowly, as we work through beginner and recently learnt tunes. If you are relatively new to playing, come along at the start.

The pace usually picks up as the evening progresses, so if you are already fluent in tunes, come along after 8:30. Of course, we'd be happy to have experienced players earlier on as well!

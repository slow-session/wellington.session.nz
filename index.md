The Wellington Session happens on Tuesday nights from 7:30 p.m. at the
<a href="/venue/">Welsh Dragon Bar</a>, 10/12 Cambridge Terrace, Wellington 6011, New Zealand.
All players of traditional Irish music are welcome. The session starts slowly, as we work
through new tunes and tunes we are just learning:

If you are relatively new to playing this music, come along right at the start.

The pace usually picks up as the evening progresses, so if you are already fluent in tunes,
come along after 8:30. Of course, we'd be happy to have experienced players playing **slowly**
earlier on as well!

Tune of the Week

We pick one tune each week for homework, and we'll play it sometime during the first hour.

    </tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
  {% assign sortedtunes = site.tunes | sort: 'title' %}
  {% assign count = 100 %}
  {% for tune in sortedtunes %}
      {% if tune.tags contains 'tuneoftheweek' and tune.tags contains 'slowsession'%}
          {% assign count = count | plus: 1 %}
<tr>

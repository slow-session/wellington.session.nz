<fieldset>
The status of the Welsh Dragon has been fluid over the last few weeks.  Please check on
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/WellingtonSession">our Facebook page</a> for the latest info on where we're meeting. Times and venues may change at short notice.
<br />
<br />
We expect things to be a bit fluid until after the New Year as we work to find a permanent home.

<br />
All players of traditional Irish music are welcome. The session starts slowly, as we work
through new tunes and tunes we are just learning:

If you are relatively new to playing this music, come along right at the start. The pace usually picks up as the evening progresses, so if you are already fluent in tunes,
come along after 8:30. Of course, we'd be happy to have experienced players playing **slowly**
earlier on as well!

You can see a list of some of the tunes that get played at the session including those we've been
learning in the slow part of the session in our <a href="/tunes_archive/">Tunes Archive</a> page.

We pick one tune each week for homework, and we'll play it sometime during the first hour.

NZ Sessions
==============

There are a number of Irish Music sessions around New Zealand but the number of musicians is relatively small. Itâ€™s a long, long way from Clare to here.

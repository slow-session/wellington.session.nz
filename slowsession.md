We meet on Tuesday nights from {{ site.slowsession_time }} at the <a href="/dragon/">Welsh Dragon Bar</a>, 10/12 Cambridge Terrace, Wellington 6011, New Zealand. Players who want to play traditional Irish music at a relaxed pace are welcome.

The slow session is an opportunity for players who are starting out with Irish traditional music and want an opportunity to play tunes that they're learning or have already learnt with others in a supportive environment. We don't teach tunes directly in this session but it's a great chance to practice playing with others. There's some scope for accompaniment but the focus is on the melody instruments.

See our <a href="/slowguidelines/">Guidelines for the Slow Session</a> if you need more information.

Tune of the Week
----------------

We pick one tune for homework each week, and we'll play it sometime during the first hour.

Slow session favourites
---------

We've got a number of tunes that we know well at the Slow Session. We don't play all of these every week but if you're at our session and want to play some of these tunes, there's a good chance someone else will know them.

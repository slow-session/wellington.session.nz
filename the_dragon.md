Two sessions happen on Tuesday nights starting at 7:30 pm at the <a href="/dragon/">Welsh Dragon Bar</a>, 10/12 Cambridge Terrace, Wellington 6011, New Zealand. Players of traditional Irish music are welcome. The evening is split into two parts with a slow session early on for those who are relatively new to Irish session music and a regular session for experienced players who are familiar with playing this music at a high standard.
